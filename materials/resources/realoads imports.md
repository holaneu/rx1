holaneu: analyze carefuly these two files in context of what it does in the context of the whole app's code base.

initialy i used update_init2.py to manualy, or by clicking the button at the UI, process modules as static imports so i can create modules and subfolders and still i will be able to import symbols simply in the code.

then i found that it worked for this purpose but it didnt do what i also expected at the end - i expecte also to process modules from all locations i need plus updating registries for UI during a runtime without a need to restart app/flask

Then i have received custom_imports code, which claims it should do what i expect. When tested, it works and do what i expect at the UI side

Answer me these qusetions:
- is it convenient to merge these two files somehow together so it will work somehow automatically without a need to call it manualy but still there will be possible to use realod button in the ui? Make is sense? Is it good from a performance or security perspective? And is it still somehow simple to maintain?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationLooking at these two files in the context of your RX1 application, I can see they serve different but related purposes:

## Current Functionality Analysis

**`update_init2.py`:**
- Generates static imports in __init__.py files using AST parsing
- Updates `__all__` lists for proper module exports
- Works with app directories and user extension directories
- Requires manual triggering (UI button or direct call)
- Reloads modules after updating imports

**`custom_imports.py`:**
- Dynamically loads user modules at runtime using `importlib`
- Updates registries (like `WORKFLOWS_REGISTRY`) automatically
- Cleans up old modules before loading new ones
- Called automatically during package initialization

## Merging Analysis

**Yes, merging makes sense, but with careful design considerations:**

### Benefits of Merging:
1. **Single responsibility**: One module handles all dynamic module loading
2. **Consistency**: Same logic for both static imports and runtime registry updates
3. **Reduced maintenance**: One file to maintain instead of two
4. **Better coordination**: Can ensure static imports and registries stay in sync

### Recommended Approach:

````python
import os
import sys
import ast
import re
import importlib
import importlib.util
from typing import Dict, List

class ModuleManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.AUTO_START = "# AUTO-GENERATED-IMPORTS-START"
        self.AUTO_END = "# AUTO-GENERATED-IMPORTS-END"
        
    def update_static_imports(self, directories: List[str]):
        """Update __init__.py files with static imports (existing functionality)"""
        # Your existing update_init2.py logic here
        pass
    
    def load_dynamic_modules(self, package_name: str, registry: Dict[str, dict]):
        """Load user modules into registries (existing functionality)"""  
        # Your existing custom_imports.py logic here
        pass
    
    def full_reload(self, target_dirs: List[str] = None):
        """Combined operation: update static imports AND reload registries"""
        if not target_dirs:
            target_dirs = ["app_dirs", "user_data_admin_dirs", "user_data_extensions_dirs"]
            
        for target in target_dirs:
            # 1. Update static imports first
            self.update_static_imports(self._get_directories_for_target(target))
            
            # 2. Then reload dynamic modules for affected packages  
            for package in ["workflows", "assistants", "tools", "prompts"]:
                registry = self._get_registry_for_package(package)
                if registry:
                    self.load_dynamic_modules(package, registry)
````

## Performance & Security Considerations:

### Performance:
- **Good**: Runtime loading only happens when needed
- **Concern**: File system scanning on every reload could be slow with many files
- **Mitigation**: Add file modification time caching to avoid unnecessary reloads

### Security:
- **Good**: Only loads from controlled directories (`APP_SETTINGS.CUSTOM_MODULES_FOLDERS`)
- **Good**: Already restricted to specific user paths
- **Consider**: Add validation for loaded module names/symbols

## Maintainability:

**Simple to maintain** if you:
1. Keep the existing API endpoints working
2. Use composition rather than cramming everything into one function
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Document the dual nature (static + dynamic) clearly

## Integration with Existing Code:

The merged solution would work well with your current `/api/reload_modules` endpoint:

````python
@app.route('/api/reload_modules', methods=['POST'])
def reload_modules():
    """Hot-reload all modules with both static imports and registry updates."""
    try:
        from app.utils.module_manager import ModuleManager
        
        manager = ModuleManager()
        with _init_update_lock:
            importlib.invalidate_caches()
            manager.full_reload()  # Does both static imports AND registry updates
            
        return {
            ResponseKey.STATUS: ResponseStatus.SUCCESS,
            ResponseKey.MESSAGE: "Reloaded modules and registries",
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            ResponseKey.STATUS: ResponseStatus.ERROR,
            ResponseKey.ERROR: f"Error: {str(e)}",
        }
````

## Recommendation:

**Yes, merge them** - it will provide a better developer experience and ensure consistency between static imports and runtime registries. The performance impact should be minimal, and it actually improves security by centralizing module loading logic.
